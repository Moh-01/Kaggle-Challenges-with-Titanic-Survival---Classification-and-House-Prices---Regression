**Primary Learning Objectives:**
1. Creating and iteratively refining a regression model and classification model on two popular getting started datasets
2. Using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to practice the modeling process and document findings on Kaggle Kernels
3. Learn from community resources on the platform and collaborate with a physical team

Here are the two competitions:
 - [House prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

 - [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

Deliverables are 2 public kernels (one for each competition) on Kaggle per team.
 - Kaggle kernel: [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/imohtn/titanic-rnm-eda-fe-modeling)
 - Kaggle kernel: [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/imohtn/house-prices-rnm-eda-fe-modeling)
